# A React Front-End Web for NBA Player Strength Visualization

This project aims to come up with a webpage for NBA Player Strength Visualization. The programming focus would be on how to design/build components and how to communicate between UI interactions using Reactjs. The backend player data comes from stats.nba.com.

The webpage is deployed at: https://wenshihao1993.github.io/NBA/
